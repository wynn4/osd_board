# osd_board
This is a custom PCB for interfacing between the Micro MinimOSD and the RCE Tricopter V4.  The board is specifically sized to mount on the back side of the V4 fpv transmitter post.  Components for the board can be found by looking at the attached documents.  The voltage regulator should be a SMD packaged LM2940-5 (for 5V) and it needs a 0.47uF 0805 package capacitor on the input and a 33uF 0805 capacitor on the output.  For more info, see the LM2940 datasheet
